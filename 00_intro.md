Rails10 is the shit!

Jeffery: Jquery is just appealing to beginners, and that's good.

Taloy: laravel is similarly positioned as Jquery. Laravel is, across all.
languages and frameworks, is at the good position to be people's first
framework. Becasue, 1. php is so easy to learn and host and cheap to host 2.
laravel is a very nature framework is someone is looking to do php, because
the syntax is very readable and easy, the document is pretty through, less
confusing than some of the alternatives. It is going to be a nature stoping
point for new developers who do not have much php experience, but they start
doing laravel

Jeffery: laravel can be appealing to both new comers and seasoned developers

课程以动手做成一个 web 应用为主线，很多地方先用本方法把功能做成，然后再看，用 rails 能够给我带来社么便利。

课程的思路是这样的：一个小功能一个小功能的做，可能的话，每个小功能都先用笨办法完成一遍，然后再用 rails 的巧妙机制完成。笨办法可以有助于理解基本的道理，让你不晕，而 rails 带来的巧妙方法，可以让代码写得更加简约整洁，便于维护。

<!-- 先用静态页面实现一个小东西，然后用 helper layout 这些概念来优化代码 -->
<!-- 先写 html 的 form 然后再用 form_for -->
